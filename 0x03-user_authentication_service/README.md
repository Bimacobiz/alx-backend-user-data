The service will handle user registration, login, session management, and password reset functionalities.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Gain an understanding of how to declare API routes in a Flask app.
- Learn how to interact with databases using SQLAlchemy.
- Understand the process of hashing passwords securely.
- Implement user authentication and session management.
- Practice handling HTTP status codes and form data in requests.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- Use of SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
- Adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines (using pycodestyle)
- All files must be executable
- Extensive documentation for all modules, classes, and functions
- Type annotations for all functions
- Implementation of unit tests is encouraged
- A README.md file providing instructions and details about the project
